# Call for Papers (CFP)

## What is a CFP?

A Call for Papers (CFP) is an open invitation for speakers to submit talk proposals for our conference. If you have expertise in a topic that would interest our audience, we'd love to hear from you!

## How to Submit

We use **Sessionize** to manage our Call for Papers. Sessionize is a professional platform that makes it easy to submit and manage talk proposals.

To submit your talk proposal:

1. write down what you want to talk about.
2. send us an email with your proposal to <office@printed-events.com>
3. we will reach out to you after 72 hours.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about the CFP process, feel free to contact us at [office@printed-events.com](office@printed-events.com).
