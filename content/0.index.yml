    - quote: ery happy to have sponsored 2x PRINTED events - both PRINTED Amsterdam and PRINTED Hub!   Getting on the ground facetime with top tier influencers, meeting some of our superfans, and networking with all kinds of brilliant people - both right before  and throughout a new product launch - was invaluable.   Printed Worldconference isn't just another trade expo - it's a way for your brand to actually be part of the community.   It's an opportunity to meet your fans, mingle with brilliant minds, and enjoy a truly unique atmosphere that helps ground your marketing and reminds you for whom and why you're building products.
