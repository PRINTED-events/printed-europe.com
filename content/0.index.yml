    - quote: Very happy to have sponsored 2x PRINTED events - both PRINTED Amsterdam and PRINTED Hub! Getting on the ground facetime with top tier influencers, meeting some of our superfans, and networking with all kinds of brilliant people - both right before and throughout a new product launch - was invaluable. Printed Worldconference isn't just another trade expo - it's a way for your brand to actually be part of the community. It's an opportunity to meet your fans, mingle with brilliant minds, and enjoy a truly unique atmosphere that helps ground your marketing and reminds you for whom and why you're building products

    - quote: Talking at PRINTED World and engaging with the next generation of creators reminded me that innovation doesn’t always come from big labs, it comes from passionate individuals daring to try something new.   At Polymaker we’re committed to supporting up-and-coming makers by giving them the material freedom, and the community they need to transform ideas into reality. It’s both inspiring and humbling to witness their journeys and it fuels us to keep pushing the boundaries of additive manufacturing together.
